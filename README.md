## Abstract

Inder Verma was a notable biologist at the Salk Institute who made significant contributions in the field of cancer biology during his time there. What is perhaps even more notable is that it took nearly four decades for his numerous accounts of sexual misconduct against his female colleagues and students to come to public light, and as a result, consequences to be decreed.

He is but just one example out of hundreds of men in STEM academia who have used their status and privilege to exploit women under their guidance and/or influence. Though the #MeToo movement has finally exposed the magnitude, breadth, and uniformity of the female experience of sexual misconduct globally, and ushered in a certain perspective shift in the way perpetrators of sexual misconduct are viewed, the playing field is still woefully uneven--women still must cope with the daily hazards of unearned male dominance. Women suffer financially, psychologically, and physically, especially in environments where men still dominate the field. The National Academy of Sciences reported in 2018 that the rate of sexual harassment in STEM is second only to that of the military. 

In “Women in STEM: A Lesson in Perseverance”, I explore different facets of sexual misconduct, harassment, and discrimination in STEM academia to highlight how the environment has protected perpetrators of sexual misconduct, and facilitated a self-perpetuating gender gap to this day. By combining insights from a database of publicly reported academic misconduct cases, reports from investigative journalism, and gender metadata pulled from scientific journal databases, I provide a comprehensive view of the harsh environment for women in STEM. I hope that this will buoy and increase efforts in advocacy for women’s rights both in and out the STEM field, as well as recognize the resilience and significance of women who have pursued and are pursuing careers in STEM.
