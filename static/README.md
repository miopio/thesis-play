TIMELINE TEXTS

STEP 1

This is a timeline of all of the publicly reported academic sexual misconduct cases in the US. There is a total of 1030 reported cases from 1979 to 2020, as of April 1, 2020. Only cases with known outcomes are shown here (all cases in 2020, and a portion of cases in 2019 are still unresolved). Note that cases of sexual misconduct are likely much higher than what is officially reported to the institutions of origin. Reports of sexual harassment have steadily increased throughout the decades, with initial cases in the late 1970s.

While the plaintiffs did not win the case, they succeeded in having Yale set in place a grievance procedure for students in the event that they experienced sexual harassment. It also established that sexual harassment could be considered sex discrimination under Title IX and was illegal.

Out of all cases, 332 of them originate from STEM fields. This is around a third of total cases. Following overall trends, reports of sexual misconduct cases have skyrocketed since 2017, when the #MeToo movement made waves throughout all of society. Many prominent scientists were exposed between 2017 and 2019 in highly publicized investigative news reports that reached beyond the niche
